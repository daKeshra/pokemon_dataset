## Data Story
  As a first timer in Pokemon games, my interest is focused on the strengths of each Pokemon and how it contributes a Pokemon trainer catching and training them as part of its collection. My data story answers questions pertianing to; 
  * the most variable types of Pokemon
  * The strongest Pokemon overall
  * The weakest pokemon based on attack ans their names
  * The weakest Pokemon based on defense and their names
  * The stronges based on attack
  * The weakest based on attak
  * The overall weakes Pokemon

# Thought process behind the story
  After testing the game, it sparked my interest to see how it builds my natural instinct on finding and collecting more Pokemons. This led me to looking and sorting the stats of each Pokemon to know their strength and weakness including what type they belong. This is the birth of my data story.
